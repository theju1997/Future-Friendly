iterators is a object which is used to iterate the elements.
In Python, an iterator is an object that allows us to traverse a container or sequence of elements,
such as a list, tuple, or string. It provides a way to access the elements of a collection one by one 
without needing to know the underlying structure or implementation details.

Iterators in Python offer a simple and efficient approach to loop over elements in a collection, making 
them an essential concept in Python programming.

An iterable is any object that can return an iterator, while an iterator is an object that provides the __next__() 
method, which retrieves the next element in the sequence.

Note: When an iterator is exhausted and has no more elements to offer, it raises a StopIteration exception.

To create our own iterator, we define a class that implements the iterator protocol. The class should have the __iter__() 
method, which returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method, which retrieves the next element. Within the __next__() method, 
we can perform any necessary computations or logic to determine the next value in the sequence.

    <pre style="font-size: 17px;">
        class TopTen:
        def __init__(self):
            self.num=1
        def __iter__(self):
            return self
        def __next__(self):
            if self.num<=10:
                val=self.num
                self.num+=1
                return val
            else:
                raise StopIteration
    values=TopTen()
    it=iter(values)
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
    print(next(it))
                         Output
