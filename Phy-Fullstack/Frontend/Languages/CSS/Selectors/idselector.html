        <h4>Introduction of ID Selectors</h4>
        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.<br>

        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!<br>
        
        To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.<br><br><br>

<style>
#Petname {
  text-align:left;
