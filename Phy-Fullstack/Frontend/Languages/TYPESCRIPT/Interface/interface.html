    <h2>Defination</h2>
   <p>(Defination for my own understanding)Interface will not allowed to come any other elements,
    Interface have some multiple action in it's own way ..
    rest of that it will not allow for other action.
    we can't add more expect the list,if we want to add we have to give ? before the variable name.<br>
      so we are going to use other topic that is Generics.</p> 
      <h2>Example---</h2>
      <p>Kindly inspect this page to check the output</p>
    </html><script src="./interface.js"></script>
</body>
