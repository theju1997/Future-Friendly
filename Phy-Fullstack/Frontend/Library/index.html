    <h2>Explination:</h2>
    <p>Frameworks and libraries are software packages that are prewritten/reusable code
        <br> modules which can be imported into a project. These standardized front-end 
         <br>technologies help front-end developers accelerate the development process
          <br>without spending copious time coding every object or 
        function from scratch.</p>
        <h2>What are libraries in frontend</h2>
        <p>They are typically used to create the user interface of a web application, 
            including the layout, design, and interactivity.<br>
             Frontend libraries are often written in JavaScript, and they<br>
              provide a range of features such as UI components, 
            animations, data visualization, and more.</p>
