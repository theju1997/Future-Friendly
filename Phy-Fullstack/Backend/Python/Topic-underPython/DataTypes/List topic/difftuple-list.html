                you cannot change its elements.  </td>

            <td>  Created using square brackets []. Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3]</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Slightly slower than tuples because of its mutability. More memory is required. </td>
            <td>  Faster and more memory-efficient due to immutability. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Suitable when you need a collection of items that might need to be modified,
                 like adding or removing elements. </td>
            <td> Preferred for situations where you want to ensure that the data remains constant throughout the program, 
                such as representing fixed collections like coordinates. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>  Has more built-in methods compared to tuples because of its mutability. 
                For example, append(), remove(), extend(), etc.</td>
            <td> Has fewer methods as it doesn't support modification. Methods include count() and index(). </td>
