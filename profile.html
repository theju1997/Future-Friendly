  <h3>Hello, everyone!

      I hope you're doing well. My name is Thejaswini TR, and I'm delighted to be here. 
      I completed my MSc in Computer Science from Bengaluru. The journey has been both 
      challenging and fulfilling, and I've gained valuable insights and skills in the field of CS.<br><br><br>
      
      Having studied in Bengaluru, I was fortunate to be surrounded by a vibrant tech
       community and countless opportunities for growth. From attending tech meetups
        to participating in hackathons, the city's dynamic atmosphere has played a significant role 
        in shaping my passion for technology.<br><br><br>
      
      I have a particular interest in exploring Phython and its applications in various domains. 
      Apart from that, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities like trowball and exploring nature whenever 
      I get the chance.<br><br><br>
      
      I'm thrilled to be part of this gathering and eager to connect with all of you. 
      Please feel free to share your experiences or anything you'd like to discuss.
       I'm looking forward to meaningful interactions and new insights during our time together.<br><br><br>
      
      Thank you, and let's make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow together! ðŸ˜Š</h3></div>
